This little sample project will show you the core concepts hidden behind the "Stack Based Virtual Machines". I'm a dummy programmer thus I have to keep the RPL (Read, Practice, Loop)
until I fully understand the concept. 

These are my resource where you can take a look too:

- [Writing Interpreters and Compilers for the Raspberry Pi Using Python by Anthony J. Dos Reis](https://amz.run/4ipU)
- [Compiler/virtual machine interpreter by RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Compiler/virtual_machine_interpreter)
- [Writing A Compiler In Go by Thorsten Ball](https://amz.run/4ipX)
